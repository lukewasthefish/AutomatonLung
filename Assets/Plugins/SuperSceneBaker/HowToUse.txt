***********************
Why Super Scene Baker?
***********************
You have multiple scenes to maintain?
Before exporting a new build, you want to make sure all the baked data of your scenes are up-to-date?
Instead of opening every scenes to check them, use Super Scene Baker to automate this process in one click! You'll never have a build with broken lightmaps anymore!


***********************
How to use it?
***********************
Check this video for see the plugin in action: https://youtu.be/KMDwFoaFHH8

* Step 1: Open Super Scene Baker
Click on the "Tool/Super Scene Baker" menu on the Unity toolbar

* Step 2: Select the scenes you want to bake
Drag and drop from you project browser the scene on the "Scenes List" property of the window
Or simply click on the "Override with scenes in build" to automatically select the scenes from the build settings (with Unity 5.5 or above).
You can clear the scene list by clicking on the "Clear list" button.

* Step 3: Choose the operations to perform
The lighting (lightmaps, AO...) is automatically baked.
You can also choose to compute other data during the process:
Check "Compute Static Occlusion" to also compute the static Occlusion Culling data.
Check "Build NavMesh" to also compute the static Navigation data.

* Step 4: Press Bake
Press the "Bake" button to launch the process.
Super Scene Baker will open, bake and save each scenes. Take a coffee during the process, because you must let it finish (like how it works when you ask Unity to build lightmaps).
You will have access to information in realtime about the progression of the process.
If for some reason you want to abort the process, click on the "Cancel" button at any time.
